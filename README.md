Basic Small World algorithm implementation

Classes to do a very basic "geographical" small world simulation.

Main is SmallWorld.java

The code generates 10 agents in a 300 by 300 field. The algorithms 
for small world connecting are broadly taken from Duncan J. Watt's 1999 paper 
"Networks, Dynamics, and Small World Phenomenon", AJS, 105(2), 493-527. 
Similar algorithms can be found in his book "Small Worlds".
